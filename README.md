# Twitter Quote Bot

A simple yet powerful bot that fetches a random quote, overlays it on a random image, and posts it to Twitter — fully automated.

## Project Overview

This project combines APIs, image processing, and social media automation to create a Twitter bot that brings inspiring (or amusing) quotes to life visually.

Each post is dynamically generated by:
1. Fetching a **random quote** from a quote API
2. Fetching a **random photo** from a list of links scrapped off internet
3. Overlaying the quote text on the image
4. Posting the final image to a **Twitter account**

## Features

-  Fully automated: No human input required after setup
-  Random images + meaningful quotes = visually engaging posts
-  Clean typography and layout for better readability
-  Auto-posting using Twitter API (OAuth v2 or v1.1)
-  Can be scheduled to post daily/hourly via a cron job or task scheduler

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pillow** – for image editing and text overlay
- **Requests** – to interact with external APIs
- **Twitter API** – for posting media and text
